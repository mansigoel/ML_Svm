# Structure of the Folder:
- All the code files have been inserted in Source Folder
- Hence insert the dataset after extraction in the Source Folder
- All the images and Plots have been inserted in Plots Folder
- For models, I have used the folder 2014062_Models which is uploaded on the drive. Kindly create a new folder with same name in Source Folder for testing.
- Usage of analysis files and val.txt have been explained in the report.

# To run:
1) Run python svm.py for ques 1 (a) part. It would create file analysis.csv and print the mean scores for each hyperparameter on terminal.
2) Similarly run python svm-b.py and svm-c.py for parts b and c respectively.

> To generate graphs of error vs C, run generate_graphs.py and manually insert the array in the script first by taking values from terminal.
> To generate cumulative roc plot for b and c, run same_roc.py
